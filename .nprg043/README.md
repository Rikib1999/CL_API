This directory (`.nprg043`) contains course-related files. To avoid cluttering
your project tree, the directory starts with a dot, which is a UNIX convention
for hidden files and directories. Most file managers (and the `ls` command) will
respect that, so depending on the platform, you might need to change to this
directory explicitly (or enable displaying hidden files in your file manager).

You will probably want to do it to edit the `.gitignore` file, and you may
be required to put (or link) some files to this directory in later tasks.

Please **DO NOT** make this directory and its contents ignored, because
it interferes with task handling.
